## 📋 Project Planning

The start of this project was heralded with the first hurdle of outlining the needs of those who would use the site. Alongside fairly standard concerns of site responsiveness, and readability, there were a few types of user taken into account, as outlined in the [project board](https://github.com/users/SourTarte/projects/3/views/1) of this repo.

After that, wireframing was tackled using photoshop, as it was more time efficient than learning new software. Using it, a representation of the final site's layout was created, as seen below, though this would be subject to change.

## 🧪 Testing

After having finished the layout of the page, the deployed site was ran through W3C's HTML and CSS validation steps. The CSS returned no results, but the HTML returned 8, which were then remedied same-day.

Then Google Chrome's lighthouse tools were used to measure a general set of performance metrics.

Lighthouse's accessibility metrics indicated the contrast ratios were poor for certain users, and so they were also tested using WebAIM's contrast ratio checking tool.
